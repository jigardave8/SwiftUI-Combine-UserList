# SwiftUI-Combine-UserList

A simple iOS app that demonstrates fetching and displaying a list of users using **SwiftUI** and **Combine**. 



This project includes structured MVVM architecture, a basic network service layer, and organized naming conventions.

## Features

- **SwiftUI & Combine**: Uses Combine for asynchronous network calls and SwiftUI for a declarative UI.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Separates business logic, data fetching, and view representation for clean, maintainable code.
- **Network Handling**: A simple `UserNetworkService` handles API calls with Combineâ€™s `URLSession` publisher.

## Project Structure

- **Model** (`UserModel.swift`): Defines the data structure for a User.
- **Network Service** (`UserNetworkService.swift`): Contains network code to fetch user data.
- **ViewModel** (`UserListViewModel.swift`): Manages data flow between the service and the SwiftUI view.
- **View** (`UserListView.swift`): Displays a list of users or an error message if fetching fails.
